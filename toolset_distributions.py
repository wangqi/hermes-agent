Toolset Distributions Module

This module defines distributions of toolsets for data generation runs.
Each distribution specifies which toolsets should be used and their probability
of being selected for any given prompt during the batch processing.

A distribution is a dictionary mapping toolset names to their selection probability (%).
Probabilities should sum to 100, but the system will normalize if they don't.

Usage:
    from toolset_distributions import get_distribution, list_distributions
    
    # Get a specific distribution
    dist = get_distribution("image_gen")
    
    # List all available distributions
    all_dists = list_distributions()
